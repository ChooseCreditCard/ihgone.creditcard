    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Hotel-Loyalty Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>A hotel-loyalty credit card is connected directly to a hotel group’s rewards program. Instead of earning generic cashback, your spending builds a balance of hotel points that can be used for free nights, discounted stays and on-property extras at participating hotels.</p>
      <p>IHG-style programs typically cover multiple brands under one umbrella. A co-branded card lets you accelerate point earning across those brands and sometimes grants you an automatic status tier, even before you complete a single stay.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Earning Points -->
    <section id="earning" class="section">
      <h2>How IHG-Style Hotel Cards Earn Points</h2>
      <p>When you pay for hotel stays with a co-branded card, you usually earn points twice: once as a loyalty member and again via the card’s boosted earn rate on partner hotels. Everyday purchases outside hotels also earn a base rate of points, with some cards offering higher rates on travel, dining or fuel.</p>
      <p>Welcome bonuses and milestone bonuses are common. Hitting a specified spend in the first few months or over a card year can unlock large point bonuses or free-night certificates that meaningfully offset the annual fee.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Status & Benefits -->
    <section id="benefits" class="section">
      <h2>Elite Status, Free Nights and On-Property Perks</h2>
      <p>Many hotel cards grant a built-in status tier in the loyalty program. Even entry-level status can include benefits like late checkout or enhanced earning rates, while higher tiers may add room upgrades, breakfast benefits or lounge access.</p>
      <p>Free-night certificates are another cornerstone perk. These are often awarded on card anniversaries or after meeting annual spend thresholds. Used at higher-category properties, a single certificate can be worth more than the annual fee on the card.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Value & Trade-Offs -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>How to Decide If a Hotel Card Fits Your Travel Pattern</h2>
      <p>To judge whether an IHG-style hotel card makes sense, start with your real behaviour: how many nights you spend in hotels each year, which cities you visit and whether the program’s properties line up with your routes.</p>
      <p>If you mostly stay within the same ecosystem and can reliably use free-night certificates, status perks and bonus earning rates, the total package can outweigh the annual fee. If you rarely stay in chain hotels, program-specific points may be harder to use than flexible rewards from a general travel card.</p>
